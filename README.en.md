## 📚 Overview

**VibeLearn AI (CUA_VL)** is a learning methodology that systematically learns new technologies, frameworks, and projects using AI, and turns the outputs generated in the process into high-quality textbooks that other learners can utilize.

### Core Philosophy

> **"Learn with AI, structure what you've learned, and pave the way for the next learner."**

- **AI Collaboration-centric**: Efficient learning by utilizing AI as a learning partner
- **Structured Process**: Track learning with clear steps and deliverables
- **Knowledge Reuse**: The learning process itself becomes a textbook for others
- **Continuous Improvement**: Maintained up-to-date through Continuous Vibe Learning (CVL)
- **Pragmatism**: Sets a practical learning scope suitable for the AI era

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Methodology

### 1. For the Individual Learner
- **Fast Learning**: Efficient learning process using AI
- **Deep Understanding**: Focus on concepts and application rather than rote memorization
- **Practical Application**: Immediately applicable through practice-oriented learning
- **Metacognition**: Improvement of the learning method itself through retrospectives

### 2. For the Learning Outputs
- **Reusable**: A textbook that other learners can use as is
- **Structured**: Systematic folder structure and naming conventions
- **Up-to-date**: Tracks and updates changes through the CVL process
- **Verified Content**: Information verified through actual practice

### 3. For the Community
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Individual learning becomes a community asset

  - `daily_learning_prompt.md`: Prompt for daily learning planning

**Features**:
- Topic-agnostic (reusable for any subject)
- Copied and customized for each Topic
- Acts as the core engine of the methodology

#### 2. **[TopicName]/vl_prompts/** Folder
- **Purpose**: Stores prompt files for the corresponding Topic
- **Creation Method**: Copied from templates/ and injected with Topic information
- **Core Files**:
  - `roadmap_prompt.md`: Roadmap generation prompt already filled with Topic information
  - `daily_learning_prompt.md`: General-purpose daily learning prompt

**Role**:
- Collaboration interface with AI
- Supports systematic learning planning

#### 3. **[TopicName]/vl_roadmap/** Folder
- **Purpose**: Stores the overall learning roadmap for the Topic
- **Filename Convention**: `YYYYMMDD_RoadMap_[TopicName].md`
- **Contents**:
  - Learning module structure (M1, M2, M3, ...)
  - Learning objectives and estimated time for each module
  - Difficulty level and required prerequisites
  - DoD (Definition of Done)

## 🔄 Continuous Vibe Learning (CVL)

### Concept
A process for detecting changes and synchronizing learning content when the learning target is a continuously changing project or technology.

### CVL Process (At the start of each learning session)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Learning Session] --> B{Use Remote<br/>Repository?}
    B -->|No| E[Check Roadmap]
    B -->|Yes| C[git fetch]
    C --> D{Changes<br/>Found?}
    D -->|No| E
    D -->|Yes| F[Analyze Changes]
    F --> G[Assess Impact]
    G --> H[Report to User]
    H --> I{Update<br/>Needed?}
    I -->|Major| J[Separate Session<br/>for Update Task]
    I -->|Medium| K[Partial Update<br/>before Today's Learning]
    I -->|Minor| E
    J --> E
    K --> E
    E --> L[Plan Today's Learning]
    L --> M[Proceed with Learning]
```

### Impact Assessment Criteria

| Impact | Example | Work Time | Action |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| **Major** | Core architecture change, major API change | 2-4 hours | Separate update session |
| **Medium** | New feature addition, function name change | 30-60 minutes | Handle before today's learning |
| **Minor** | Documentation update, minor bug fix | 5 minutes | Record as a note in WorkLog |

### CVL WorkLog Entry
```markdown
## 🔄 Continuous Vibe Learning - Repository Synchronization

**Sync Time**: 2025-12-14 09:00
**Remote Commit**: abc1234 - "Add new feature X"
**Previous Local**: def5678 - "Previous version"

### Key Changes
1. Added new feature X
2. Refactored module Y

### Learning Material Updates
- [ ] 01-Basics: No changes
- [x] 02-Advanced: Added section for feature X
- [ ] WorkLog: Noted for reference

### Impact on Today's Learning
- Feature X will be covered in M5, so no current impact.
```

## 🔍 Retrospective Mechanism

### 3-Stage Retrospective Structure

#### 1. Daily Retrospective (At the end of each day's learning)
- **Location**: Within the day's WorkLog file
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Content**:
  - What went well?
  - What didn't go well?
  - What did I learn?
  - Action Items
  - Tomorrow's Focus

#### 2. Module Retrospective (Upon completion of each module)
- **Location**: `vl_worklog/YYYYMMDD_[ModuleName]_Retrospective.md`
- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes
- **Content**:
  - Plan vs. Actual comparison (time, difficulty)
  - Achievement of learning objectives
  - Key Learnings
  - Problems encountered and solutions
  - Suggestions for improving the methodology
  - Roadmap accuracy assessment
  - Output quality assessment
  - Preparation for the next module

#### 3. Topic Retrospective (Upon completion of the entire Topic)

- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **Content**:
  - Overall learning journey statistics
  - Evaluation of the CUA_VL methodology's effectiveness
  - Topic-specific characteristics and insights
  - Methodology improvements (to apply to the next Topic)
  - Textbook quality assessment of outputs

### Value of Retrospectives

## 🎓 Self-Assessment

### Learning Evaluation Philosophy in the AI Era

> **"There is no need to memorize every detail. An understanding sufficient to effectively instruct an AI is enough."**

### Scope of Evaluation

#### ✅ What Humans Should Know
1. **Conceptual Understanding**
   - What the technology/project is
   - Why it is used (the problem it solves)
   - When to use it (application scenarios)
   - Differences from alternative technologies

2. **Architectural Understanding**
   - Overall structure and components
   - Relationships between major components
   - Data/control flow

3. **Practical Application Ability**
   - Basic installation and setup methods
   - 3-5 key commands/APIs
   - Common usage patterns
   - Common troubleshooting methods

4. **AI Utilization Ability**
   - Accurately conveying requirements to the AI
   - Judging the quality of AI-generated code
   - Suggesting debugging directions when problems arise

#### ❌ What Humans Don't Need to Memorize
- Detailed API parameter lists
- Complex configuration file syntax
- All edge cases
- Internal implementation details of libraries

### Self-Assessment Checklist

Self-assess the following upon completing each module:

```markdown
## Self-Assessment: [Module Name]

### 1. Conceptual Understanding (5 min)
- [ ] Can explain what this technology/feature is in 1-2 sentences
- [ ] Can explain why it's needed with examples
- [ ] Can explain the differences from similar technologies

### 2. Practical Application (10 min)
- [ ] Can perform basic installation/setup without AI help
- [ ] Can request 3 key commands from the AI
- [ ] Can implement a simple example with the AI

### 3. AI Collaboration Ability (5 min)
- [ ] Can ask the AI to write code using this technology
- [ ] Can judge whether the AI-generated code is correct
- [ ] Can suggest a debugging direction to the AI if a problem occurs

### 4. Textbook Quality (5 min)
- [ ] Others can learn from the outputs I've created
- [ ] Verified that all examples actually work
- [ ] Sufficient troubleshooting information is included

### Score
- All checked: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect)
- 10-11 checks: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)
- 8-9 checks: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good)
- 6-7 checks: ⭐⭐ (Needs Review)
- 5 or fewer: ⭐ (Re-learning Recommended)
```

### Practice Problem Design Principles

Self-Assessment practice problems follow these principles:

1. **AI Utilization Premise**: Problems to be solved "with AI"
2. **Concept-centric**: Confirm conceptual understanding rather than details
3. **Practicality**: Scenarios likely to be encountered in real work
4. **Short Time**: Solved within 5-10 minutes per problem

**Example Problem**:
```markdown
## Practice Problem: Create an MCP Server

**Scenario**:
You need to create an MCP server that provides a simple file-reading function.

**What you need to do**:
1. Clearly communicate the requirements to the AI
2. Review the code generated by the AI (check if the structure is correct)
3. If there are problems after running, suggest a debugging direction to the AI

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- [ ] Requested compliance with the MCP protocol from the AI
- [ ] Identified major components in the generated code (server, tools, handler)
- [ ] Confirmed normal operation after execution

**Allowed Time**: 10 minutes (including AI assistance)
```
