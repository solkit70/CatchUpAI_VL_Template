## 🚀 Next Steps

### After completing this file:

1.  **Request Topic folder creation**
    -   Provide this file to the AI.
    -   Request: "Please create the Topic folder structure based on this topic_starter.md."

2.  **Folder structure to be created**
    ```
    [TopicName]/
    ├── topic_info.md              # This file will be copied
    ├── vl_prompts/
    │   ├── roadmap_prompt.md      # Prompt injected with Topic info
    │   └── daily_learning_prompt.md
    ├── vl_roadmap/                # Location for Roadmap
    ├── vl_worklog/                # Location for learning logs
    └── vl_materials/              # Location for reference materials (Optional)
    ```

3.  **Generate Roadmap**
    -   Provide the `[TopicName]/vl_prompts/roadmap_prompt.md` file to the AI.
    -   The AI will generate a systematic learning roadmap.
    -   Save the generated roadmap in the `vl_roadmap/` folder.

4.  **Start Learning!**
    -   Proceed with daily learning using `daily_learning_prompt.md`.
    -   Track progress by writing a WorkLog.
    -   Continuously improve with Retrospectives.

## 💡 Writing Tips

### ✅ Do's (Recommended)
-   **Be specific**: "Learn a framework" → "Build a RESTful API with FastAPI"
-   **Make it verifiable**: "Understand" → "Be able to implement it myself"
-   **Be realistic**: Don't set the estimated period too tightly.
-   **Include reference materials**: Specify links or documents that will help with learning.

### ❌ Don'ts (To be avoided)
-   Too broad a Topic (e.g., "Programming in general")
-   Vague objectives (e.g., "get good at it," "learn a lot")
-   Unrealistic period (e.g., "become an expert in 1 week")
-   Starting without reference materials
